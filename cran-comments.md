## Resubmission (Version 0.1.0)

This is a resubmission of the package with the following changes:

- Changed the package name from `ALLSPICE` to `ALLSPICER` as requested to avoid conflict with an existing package.
- Fixed namespace conflicts with `stats::filter` and `dplyr::filter` by using explicit namespace calls.
- Updated the package description and title to follow CRAN guidelines (removed package name from the title and improved the description).
- Removed the non-standard top-level directory `analysis` and added it to `.Rbuildignore`.
- Improved the efficiency of the core functions by optimizing internal data structures.
- Enhanced documentation and examples for key functions.
